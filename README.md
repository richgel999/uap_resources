# Key OSINT UAP Resources
At this point in the UAP Disclosure (or "Scheduled Dissemination" - Ramirez) Process, what's been missing is a compilation of the key information from the historical and modern-day people with [Security Clearances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_clearance). This repo aims to fill that gap.

Some of the key UAP related reading/listening materials are from Corso, Crain, Elizondo, Davis, Puthoff, Ramirez, Hastings and Hill, Astronaut Dr. Edgar Mitchell (the 6th person on the Moon), a few 1940's-1950's-era memo/report leaks, the declassified Austrialian report, and at least two NY Times articles (one published during the height of the pandemic in 2020, so it was probably missed by most). 

I believe this key material, taken as a whole using [Bayesian inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference), tells a reasonably coherent picture of UAP C/R's ("crash recoveries" or "crash retrievals" - NY Times, Puthoff/Davis/Corso/Crain/Mitchell) since the late 40's, and an active R&D (NY Times, Corso, Crain) and "Crash Retrieval Program" (NY Times, Davis, Admiral Wilson/Dr. Mitchell leak) that seeded US industry with "exotic materials" (Corso, Crain, Elizondo) or "retrieved materials" (NY Times). 

[Lue Elizondo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Elizondo) was right: "Do yourself a favor and arm yourself with knowledge. Be very careful who you listen [to] and the information that comes out...You know, look into their background."

## NY Times Confirmation 7/28/2020

This came out during the height of the pandemic, so we all missed it:

Davis says "SCIF" a couple times in this interview. This means a "Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility":<br>

For some verification, Christopher Mellon (former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense), when asked on CNN if he believed there are "objects in our possession that are from something other than this Earth", replied "that assertion should be taken seriously" (then later said that again). He also said he knew Davis well, and that Trump was considering declassifying information about Roswell.<br>

Davis, Admiral Wilson, and Dr. Edgar Mitchell are all strongly linked:<br>
https://twitter.com/richgel999/status/1511242287875080194

The original security leak seems to be due to Dr. Edgar Mitchell's documents being found somewhat accidently after he passed away:<br>
https://richarddolanmembers.com/articles/article-ufo-leak-of-the-century-richard-dolan-analyzes-the-admiral-wilson-leak/<br>

The Wilson leak aligns with what Dr. Eric Davis has been saying in public: There have been crashes, there's an R&D program, etc. It mentions Dr. Eric W Davis (NIDS).

"Dr. Hal Puthoff Address to the SSE/IRVA Conference, Las Vegas, 8 June 2018" (from @kentbye):<br>

"The third area, Unidentified Aerial Phenomena, I have not published anything in. Why? Because the program I was involved in, in the Pentagon and in the intelligence community has been Top Secret, behind-the-scenes and only recently has there been release of information about the program.  So this is the first chance that I’ve had a chance to actually appear before the public and speak about details of the program and not go to jail. So I’m going to go along at a rapid clip; I’ve got a lot of information here. So here we go."

## Key Statement by Astronaut Dr. Edgar Mitchell

Astronaut [Dr. Edgar Mitchell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Mitchell) - Lunar Module Pilot of Apollo 14. He spent nine hours working on the lunar surface in the Fra Mauro Highlands region, making him the sixth person to walk on the Moon.<br>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeBtSnRGSus

Transcript: "There have been ET visitation. There have been crashed craft. 
There have been material and bodies recovered, and there is some group of people
somewhere that may or may not be associated with government at this point, but
certainly were at one time, that have this knowledge and have been attempting to
conceal this knowledge are not permitted to be widely disseminated."

This matches strongly with Corso and Davis, partially with Elizondo, weakly Puthoff, and strongly with the [Admiral Wilson Leak](https://www.theblackvault.com/casefiles/the-admiral-wilson-leak-an-analysis/).

Another set of interviews. I may elevate Edgar Mitchell to a key source:<br>

## Vallée: "Pentacle" Memorandum

A key 1953 document found by early researcher and computer scientist [Jacques Vallée](https://www.jacquesvallee.net/), which he pushed to get officially declassified. Vallée stated in [The Phenomenon](https://www.amazon.com/Phenomenon-John-Podesta/dp/B08HR9BVNM/ref=sr_1_1) documentary that this document "changed his life". Document was signed by H.C. Cross (Dr. Howard C. Cross) - Director of Exotic Metallergy - [Battelle Memorial Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battelle_Memorial_Institute) - US National Labs.

This document demonstrated that the US military took the UAP problem so seriously that they had another independent and secret data collection/analysis program, parallel to the public [Blue Book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Blue_Book) program.

## Key Technologies

If you have any actual "exotic materials" (say, from a crashed UAP) you should contact the TTSA or [To The Stars](https://www.linkedin.com/company/to-the-stars-inc-/about/) folks ASAP. Be sure to get a contract signed before handing over anything. Also note that you should be careful, because Russian and Chinese intelligence will be wanting to get their hands on this strategically important technological astromaterial. 

Metamaterials and Metamaterial Antennas are a _crucial technology_:<br>
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamaterial<br>
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamaterial_antenna

### 1988 "UFO Cover-Up?: Live!" 

A significant two hour live special from Washington DC in 1988. Had a live studio audience in [Gulf Breeze, FL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJzLKIqp-3w), a hotspot. Included some classified information (for '88) in the White House organization chart shown at 1:08:23. This special seemed to be trying to suppress a panic. The [Cash-Landrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash%E2%80%93Landrum_incident) witnesses were interviewed. It had a live telephone survey, asking the audience if Congressional Hearings should take place (the audience voted yes).

"The existence of the Parapsychology Research Unit, and in particular the DIA management of the "weird" division of the Intelligence Community, was still classified as SECRET/NOFORN/WNINTEL according to a FOIA CIA-released STAR GATE review of government parapsychology research dated May 10, 1995."

## Wildcards 

_This category is the rough equivalent to Corso's "Nut File". This information seems to fit into the very edges of the puzzle. It may be real, or it may be nuts. Can't tell - currently._

### Leaked Manual: "SOM 1-01: Extraterrestrial Entities and Technology, Recovery and Disposal"
_Pre-disclosure. Probably fake._

This seems too well done/organized for 1954, but still makes for an interesting read. Great [X-COM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XCOM) material at the minimum.<br>

https://majesticdocuments.com/pdf/som101_part1.pdf<br>
https://majesticdocuments.com/pdf/som101_part2.pdf

Seems to align with statements made by Corso, Davis, possibly Elizondo.

### "The Messengers: Owls, Synchronicity and the UFO Abductee", by Mike Clelland  (Author), Richard Dolan (Intro):<br>
This book covers screen or false memories. I'm including it because externally induced screen or false memories seem to be occasionally part of the phenomenon, but this could be unrelated.<br>
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08J8BSPTC

### Sherman 
_Pre-disclosure. Claimed to have a clearance. I doubt this is real, but who knows._

"ABOVE BLACK - Project Preserve Destiny - An Insider's Account of Alien Contact and Government Coverup", Dan Sherman (USAF, worked for the NSA as an Electronic Intelligence Specialist)<br>

"During his twelve years in service he was recognised for heroism and has been decorated with the AF Commendation Medal, as well as the AF Achievement Medal with two oak leaf clusters and was honoured for service in the Persian Gulf War."

~95% of his book is a vanilla story about working for the USAF/NSA. Very little of the book covers his claimed interactions with NHI's on behalf of the NSA. I have a problem accepting this as "canon" because if it's true the NSA has advanced quite far with NHI communication. Perhaps it was "enhanced" with the NHI comms part to sell copies.
